                <p>For your info: A library is a place where books and sources of information are stored. They make it
                    easier for people to get access to them for various purposes. Libraries are very helpful and
                    economical too. They include books, magazines, newspapers, DVDs, manuscripts and more.</p>

                <h3>Do Something Productive.</h3>
                <p>Again for your info: Productivity is commonly defined as a ratio between the output volume and the
                    volume of inputs. In other words, it measures how efficiently production inputs, such as labour and
                    capital, are being used in an economy to produce a given level of output.</p>
